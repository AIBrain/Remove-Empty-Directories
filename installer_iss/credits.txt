CREDITS

Thanks a lot to all who donated to the project! I did not really think
that I receive a single donation, but it turns out that quite a few
people seem to use and like RED :-)

For now, I removed the donation button because I have a guilty
conscience with regard to my decreasing time to improve RED. 
BTW: Sorry for not updating RED for a long time now, I was really 
busy with "real life"... 

Special thanks to:

  * Wolf and the Computer Club Sunland Village (Mesa Arizona) 
    for their continuous kind feedback!

  * Havy A.C. (ZyntaXis) for helping me with the Windows 7 
    and Vista compatibility



DISCLAIMER

To be honest with you as user of RED I have to tell you that one user of 
RED (Version 2.1) reported that it deleted folders which were not empty 
and contained important files. I'm really very sorry for that! I checked 
all routines of RED several times to ensure nothing goes wrong, but somehow 
it happened on the system of that user. Unfortunately, I could not really 
determine what caused that behaviour. In addition to that the user did not 
wanted to try to locate the error, because he was (understandably) very 
upset and uninstalled RED instantly. But he told me that the directory 
names he scanned contained chinese characters. Therefore I tried to reproduce 
the error with chinese directory names but it did not work out - RED worked 
as expected. 

My conclusion: I currently assume it was a individual case and hope that it 
does not happen again. I also refactored and optimited the whole sourcecode 
of RED 2.2 to improve the stability and the error handling.

To sum up, if you use RED for the first time have a look at the directories 
RED found and rethink if they are plausible. And if you want to be really 
safe double-click a few to see if they are really empty. This especially 
applies to systems with directory names containing any special characters. 
Contact me if you notice anything strange.

(By the way: As I orginally developed RED for myself and I'm using it often 
I took particular care to ensure everything works correctly.)



HINTS & FAQ

  * Right click on a directory in the tree to get more options.
  
  * You can use Regular expressions (Regex) in the "Ignore these 
    files" filter lists by putting the filter between two slashes.
    Example: /^tmp\.[0-9]+/

  * Why am I getting these annoying "cannot access the file" or 
    "Access to ... is denied." errors?
    That means that another application locked a file or a 
    directory so that RED can't access or delete it.

  * Why .NET Framework!?
    I'm sorry that RED requires the .NET Framework (the "Java" of 
    Microsoft) -- its really bloated. But actually I did not had 
    the time to learn a "mature" programming language like C++. 
    And nowadays every new windows comes with .NET preinstalled 
    so it should work without...
