Copyright (c) 2005-2007 by Jonas John. All rights reserved.
First release: Aug 04, 2005 -- Last update: Apr 08, 2007
=====================================================================


DESCRIPTION
---------------------------------------------------------------------
RED searches and deletes empty directories recursively below a given 
start folder and shows the result in a well arranged tree. Further 
you can create some custom rules for keeping and deleting folders. 
Empty files in directories can also be ignored. Just try RED to 
see the other features - no registry keys or system files 
will be touched. 


WARNING
---------------------------------------------------------------------
I can not guarantee that RED works 100% accurate. I made many tests
and checked the source code twice but it still may contain some 
unknown bugs. So use RED at your own risk!


System Requirements
---------------------------------------------------------------------

- Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0

(The installer should check if you have installed the .NET Framework 2.0 
and will install it if not)


Configuration
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Look into the "Settings" Tab-Panel, the options should be 
self-describing. 


Feedback
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Feedback is always appreciated and you can provide it by using my
forum at http://www.jonasjohn.de/forum/. Or use the contact

Development
---------------------------------------------------------------------
The first version of RED was made with PHP by using Winbinder.
But because I'm currently learning C# I started using Microsoft 
Visual C# since Version 1.5. 
 
RED was tested with:
--> Windows XP (Home)
--> (but should also work with all .NET compatible systems)
