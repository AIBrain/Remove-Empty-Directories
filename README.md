Remove Empty Directories (RED)
==============================

RED searches, displays and deletes empty directories recursively below a given start folder.
Furthermore it allows you to create custom rules for keeping and deleting folders (e.g. treat
directories with empty files as empty).


## Features

- Simple user interface
- Shows empty directories before deleting them
- Supports multiple delete modes (including Delete to recycle bin)
- Allows white and black listing of directories by using filter lists
- Can detect directories with empty files as empty


## System requirements

- Windows XP, Vista or 7 and RED might also work with Windows 8 and Linux (by using [Mono](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mono_%28software%29))
- Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5 or later (the installer should check that)


## Development

RED is developed by [Jonas John](http://www.jonasjohn.de/) ([@hxseven](http://twitter.com/hxseven)).
