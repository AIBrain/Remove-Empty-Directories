Remove Empty Folders (REF)
==============================

REF searches, displays and recursively deletes empty folders below a given start folder.
Furthermore it allows you to create custom rules for keeping and deleting folders (e.g. treat
folders with empty files as empty).


## Features

- Simple user interface.
- Shows empty folders before deleting them.
- Supports multiple delete modes (including Delete to Recycle Bin).
- Allows white and black listing of folders by using filter lists.
- Can detect folders with empty files as empty.


## System requirements

- Windows XP, Vista or 7 and REF might also work with Windows 8 and Linux (by using [Mono](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mono_%28software%29))
- Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5 or later (the installer should check that)

REF is developed by [Jonas John](http://www.jonasjohn.de/) ([@hxseven](http://twitter.com/hxseven)).
